Introduction
============

Face detection and recognition is an important field of Computer Vision due to
the high range of applications it concerns, many different ideas and instruments
have been invented to deal with this problem and to date really efficient and
effective solutions exist. This little library aims to build a complete simple 
and fast pipeline for face recognition leveraging on modern techniques.

In order to achieve face recognition a sequence of different steps must be carried
out, presented below.
